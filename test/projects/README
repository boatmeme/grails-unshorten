/test/projects/unshortenapp

This directory contains a Grails App meant for testing the grails-unshorten plugin. It is configured to reference the plugin code inline at ../../..

This means you can alter the plugin code and test it in a client without the need to "package-plugin" and reinstall the zip file

You still may need to restart the app after making changes to the plugin, but it is a bit more convenient. 

At the index of the app, there is an Ajax form for testing the plugin API
